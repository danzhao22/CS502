          Proposal: Statistical Analysis of pleiotropy between obesity and substance dependence
        </h3>
        <p>
        Obesity has a profound impact on individual physical health and on public health care. Obesity normally occurs when the consumed calories exceed the expended calories, this imbalanced energy situation can result from complex genetic and environment factors. For a long time, drug and alcohol dependence has been linked to obesity. A study suggests that both food and drugs abuse can be influenced by taste, pleasure, habits, social interactions, convenience, availability, and stress.
        </p>
        <p>
        Aside from environment factors, a fast growing consensus is that obesity and substance addition might have similar neurobiological framework in brain.5 Neurotransmitters respond to psychoactive substances are also sensitive to the reinforcing properties of food.6 One study found that individuals with fewer D2 receptors have to eat more in order to experience the rewarding properties of food intake. Several studies have been done to explore the shared genetic susceptibilities of obesity and substance addition. The most widely studied of these has been the dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) gene. However, many large analyses have failed to replicate these finding.
        </p>
        <p>
        Given our limited understanding of the genetic determinants and metabolic syndrome of obesity and substance addition, the shared risk gene cannot be identified. We will first perform genome-wide association analyses in GCD dataset to identify genetic variants associated with obesity and substance dependence status. Then, mixed linear model will be conducted to estimate the total variance in liability explained by SNPs through the estimation of genetic relationship matrix. Next, a bivariate REML method will be applied to estimate the genetic correlation explained by SNPs between the two traits with genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism data. Finally, the central nervous system annotation data and pleiotropy information will be integrated to prioritizing GWAS results.
